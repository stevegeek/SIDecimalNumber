Cappuccino: SIDecimal & SIDecimalNumber
========================================
(and SIDecimalNumberHandler and related tests)

Announcing SIDecimal and SIDecimalNumber:

(and SIDecimalNumberHandler and related tests)

Decimal number support for the Cappuccino framework. A port of the NSDecimal
and NSDecimalNumber classes from Cocoa via GNUStep i.e. SIDecimal is a port
of the GNUStep implementation of NSDecimal. It is actually a loose port of
GNUStep, i.e. quite a lot has been changed but the original inspirations are
from it.
